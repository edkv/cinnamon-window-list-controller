## About

A Cinnamon extension that provides useful keyboard shortcuts for controlling
opened windows.

## Installation

```
cd ~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions
git clone https://github.com/edkv/cinnamon-window-list-controller.git window-list-controller@edkv
```

And then activate it in System Settings / Extensions.

## Usage

* Cycle through windows (like `Alt+Tab` but in predictable order from your 
Window List applet) with `Shift+Alt+Right` and `Shift+Alt+Left`.

* Move them with `Super+Alt+Right` and `Super+Alt+Left`.

* Activate window 1-10 with `Super+Number`.

* All shortcuts are configurable.
